A tasklist where you let random chance pick what you will do first
# Manual
Input each task or upload a .txt file containing the tasks. You can edit each task before running them through the randomizer. The chosen task will be highlighted and you can choose to remove or delete each task. Then, you can run through the list again. If you want to save the current list for another day, you can save a .txt file containing the current tasks. There is also a clear button to clear all the tasks at once.
